#Beta is the number of times to simulate each sampled parameter set.

#User-supplied data.

#times: For abc-SMC, times must be a comma-delimited list starting with 0.
#For simulation only the first and last timepoints are used.
#To make a synthetic data set give a comma-delimited list of timepoints at which data points are required.

#variables: For abc-SMC, comma-delimited lists of concentrations (ODE or SDE) or molecule numbers (Gillespie).
#Denote your data as variable1, variable2, ..., variableN.
#For simulation or synthetic data sets these data are ignored.
#See fitting instruction below if the dimensionality of your data sets differ from the dimensionality of your model.

#type: the method used to simulate your model. ODE, SDE or Gillespie.

#Initial values: Comma-delimited list.
#Initial values are taken from the SBML model and are in the same order as the species
#are given in the model.

#Fitting information. If fit is None, all species in the model are fitted to the data in the order they are listed in the model.
#Otherwise, give a comma-delimited list of fitting instrictions the same length as the dimensions of your data.
#Use speciesN to denote the Nth species in your model. Simple arithmatic operations can be performed on the species from your model.
#For example, to fit the sum of the first two species in your model to your first variable, write fit: species1+species2

fit: None

#Parameters:
#Priors:

#Kernels: By default, gaussian with variance half the range of the prior distribution.
#To force an alternative kernel use the switch in abcScript.py and give one of 
#	uniform, lower, upper
#	gaussian, mean, variance
