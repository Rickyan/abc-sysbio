#type: the method used to simulate your model. ODE, SDE or Gillespie.

type: ODE

#Initial values: Comma-delimited list.
#Initial values are taken from the SBML model and are in the same order as the species
#are given in the model.

initial values: 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3.0 

#Fitting information. If fit is None, all species in the model are fitted to the data in the order they are listed in the model.
#Otherwise, give a comma-delimited list of fitting instructions the same length as the dimensions of your data.
#Use speciesN to denote the Nth species in your model. Simple arithmatic operations can be performed on the species from your model.
#For example, to fit the sum of the first two species in your model to your first variable, write fit: species1+species2

fit: species1, species3, species5
